## Instillation 
The user would clone the git repository, needs node on their computer and initialize the application with "npm i" to get things like console.table, mysql2, and inquirer
## Usage 
To launch the user would write "node index.js" in the integrated terminal and then would use the up and down arrow keys in the menu that would pop up to choose an action item. From there, different action items would give the user different prompts to answer or different lists to select options for. To quit the application, the user simply needs to choose "Done" from the main menu
